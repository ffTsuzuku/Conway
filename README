This Github Repository Is for My Conways Game of Life Project.
It will be build using C, and will be improved as time goes on.
As it currently stands, it allows you to enter in a file which contains a
pattern, and allows you to pick the number of generations for which the game
should play out. It then Outputs the Initial and End result onto the console, and a file.
